# vue-todo

## About Project 

This is the progressive ToDo app done using Vue, Vuex, VueRouter, Firebase(firestore).

Following features: 
- registration/login components
- main component ToDo (which contains 3 colums such as: List column, Tasks column and Options column) 
- detailed options modal
- notification component that indicates all the changes done in the website by green (success) and red (error) colors 

## Remember 

Reloading page manually will make you to relog-in due to fact that all the app is working on the client side.
All the data are fetching and posting to Firebase (firestore) cloud storage so it will be saved after your next logging to the website.


## Things to be fixed:

- sorting by name option is not working the way it should works.
